#FIRST PROJECT :-

🤖 Rule-Based Chatbot (Python + Tkinter GUI)

A simple and colorful rule-based chatbot built using Python. It uses pattern matching with re and provides a friendly GUI using Tkinter.

✨ Features

✅ Pattern-based responses (greetings, help, time, weather, etc.)

✅ Color-coded GUI with user-friendly design

✅ Scrollable chat window

✅ Easy to customize and extend

✅ Great for beginners learning about chatbot logic and GUI development

📋 Example Questions You Can Ask

"Hi"

"How are you?"

"What's your name?"

"What time is it?"

"Tell me the weather"

"Bye"

📁 Files

chatbot_gui.py: Main Python file with GUI + chatbot logic

README.md: Project documentation

💡 Future Improvements (Optional Ideas)

*Add voice input/output

*Add NLP-based responses (using NLTK or spaCy)

*Add a dark/light theme toggle

*Add external API integration for weather, jokes, etc.

#SECOUND PROJECT :-

🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe AI (Python GUI + Dark Mode + Unbeatable AI)

An advanced, stylish Tic-Tac-Toe game built with Python Tkinter, featuring an unbeatable AI powered by the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning, a clean dark theme, and a live score counter.

✨ Features :-

🤖 Unbeatable AI using Minimax + Alpha-Beta Pruning

🌙 Dark-themed GUI with modern color palette

🧮 Score tracking for Human vs AI

🔁 Auto-reset after each game (win/lose/draw)

🎯 Fully interactive Tkinter buttons with visual feedback

🎮 How to Play

You (the human) are X

The AI is O

Click on any cell to make your move

The AI will instantly counter with the best possible move

Win or lose, the game resets and the score updates automatically

🧠 How the AI Works

The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to explore all possible outcomes

It applies Alpha-Beta Pruning to eliminate unnecessary branches, making it efficient even in a small grid

Result: It can never be beaten

#THIRD PROJECT :-

📚 Recommendation System

This project presents a content-based recommendation system designed to suggest relevant items—such as movies, books, or products—based solely on item attributes rather than user interactions. Unlike collaborative filtering, which relies on user ratings or behavior patterns, this system focuses on analyzing features of the items themselves (e.g., genres, keywords, categories, descriptions).

🔍 Key Features

Content-Based Filtering: Uses item metadata (such as genre, author, tags, or product category) to compute similarity scores.

TF-IDF & Cosine Similarity: For textual data like descriptions or keywords, the system applies TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to identify and recommend similar items.

Scalable & Lightweight: No dependency on user data; can be scaled easily for cold-start items or new users.

Modular Design: Easy to extend with additional item features or hybrid approaches in the future.

📦 Applications

Movie Recommender: Recommends movies based on genre, plot keywords, and cast.

Book Recommender: Suggests books based on author, genre, and summary.

Product Recommender: Recommends similar products based on category, description, and specifications.

🛠️ Technologies Used

👨‍💻 Programming Language

Python – Core programming language used for building the recommendation logic and data processing.

📦 Libraries & Tools

Pandas – For data manipulation and preprocessing.

NumPy – For numerical computations and array operations.

Scikit-learn – For implementing:

TF-IDF Vectorizer (from sklearn.feature_extraction.text)

Cosine Similarity (from sklearn.metrics.pairwise)

NLTK / spaCy (optional) – For natural language processing tasks like tokenization or stopword removal.

Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional) – For visualizing item similarities or recommendation patterns.

🌐 User Interface (Optional)
Tkinter / PyQt5 / Streamlit – To build a simple GUI or web-based interface for interacting with the recommendation engine.

🗃️ Data Sources
Custom CSV or JSON datasets containing item metadata (e.g., movies, books, or products).
