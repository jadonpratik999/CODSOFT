Thanks to CodSoft for providing this internship opportunity and helping me gain hands-on experience in AI and ML.

#FIRST PROJECT :-

🤖 Rule-Based Chatbot (Python + Tkinter GUI)

A simple and colorful rule-based chatbot built using Python. It uses pattern matching with re and provides a friendly GUI using Tkinter.

✨ Features

✅ Pattern-based responses (greetings, help, time, weather, etc.)

✅ Color-coded GUI with user-friendly design

✅ Scrollable chat window

✅ Easy to customize and extend

✅ Great for beginners learning about chatbot logic and GUI development

📋 Example Questions You Can Ask

"Hi"

"How are you?"

"What's your name?"

"What time is it?"

"Tell me the weather"

"Bye"

📁 Files

chatbot_gui.py: Main Python file with GUI + chatbot logic

README.md: Project documentation

💡 Future Improvements (Optional Ideas)

*Add voice input/output

*Add NLP-based responses (using NLTK or spaCy)

*Add a dark/light theme toggle

*Add external API integration for weather, jokes, etc.

#SECOUND PROJECT :-

🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe AI (Python GUI + Dark Mode + Unbeatable AI)

An advanced, stylish Tic-Tac-Toe game built with Python Tkinter, featuring an unbeatable AI powered by the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning, a clean dark theme, and a live score counter.

✨ Features :-

🤖 Unbeatable AI using Minimax + Alpha-Beta Pruning

🌙 Dark-themed GUI with modern color palette

🧮 Score tracking for Human vs AI

🔁 Auto-reset after each game (win/lose/draw)

🎯 Fully interactive Tkinter buttons with visual feedback

🎮 How to Play

You (the human) are X

The AI is O

Click on any cell to make your move

The AI will instantly counter with the best possible move

Win or lose, the game resets and the score updates automatically

🧠 How the AI Works

The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to explore all possible outcomes

It applies Alpha-Beta Pruning to eliminate unnecessary branches, making it efficient even in a small grid

Result: It can never be beaten
